python-webpack
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markfinger/python-webpack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/markfinger/python-webpack)

Python bindings to [webpack](https://webpack.github.io). 

Parses modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules, enabling you 
to package your assets so that they can be reused on the clientside.

```python
from webpack.compiler import webpack

assets = webpack('/path/to/webpack.config.js')

# Absolute paths to the compiled assets
assets.get_paths()

# Render <script> and <link> elements pointing to the assets
assets.render()
```

python-webpack uses [webpack-wrapper](https://github.com/markfinger/webpack-wrapper) to provide support
for multiple concurrent compilers, file caching, and change detection of files.

Installation
------------

Webpack depends on [js-host](https://github.com/markfinger/python-js-host/) to provide
interoperability with JavaScript. Complete its 
[quick start](https://github.com/markfinger/python-js-host/#quick-start) before continuing.

Install webpack's JS dependencies

```bash
npm install --save webpack webpack-wrapper@0.5
```

Add webpack-wrapper to the functions definition of your `host.config.js` file

```javascript
module.exports = {
  functions: {
    // ...
    webpack: require('webpack-wrapper')
  }
};
```

And install python-webpack

```bash
pip install webpack
```


Usage
-----

python-webpack takes paths to [config files](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html) and passes
them to a compiler. Once the compiler has built the assets, it returns an object which enables you to interact
with the results of the build process.

```python
from webpack.compiler import webpack

assets = webpack('/path/to/webpack.config.js')

# Returns a string containing <script> and <link> elements pointing 
# to the generated assets
assets.render()

# Returns absolute paths to the generated assets on your filesystem
assets.get_paths()

# Returns urls pointing to the generated assets
assets.get_urls()

# Returns the config object generated by the compiler
assets.get_config()

# Returns a string matching the `library` property of your config file
assets.get_var()
```


Output paths
------------

A helper is provided for configuring your config's output path, simply leave the setting undefined and 
it will be preprocessed before compilation begins.

The config's `output.path` property is generated by joining your `STATIC_ROOT`, `OUTPUT_DIR` and 
`BUNDLE_DIR` settings.


Development
-----------

During development, file watchers are used to detect changes to your source files. Whenever a change is
detected, the compilers starts rebuilding in the background. If a rebuild is underway, the compiler will 
block the request until the build has completed.


Precompiling assets for production
----------------------------------

You will generally want to precompile your assets for a production environment. To do so, add your 
config files to the `CACHE` setting, for example

```python
import os

webpack.conf.settings.configure(
  # ...
  CACHE=(
    os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, 'webpack.config.js'),
  ),
)
```

and then run the following

```python
from webpack.cache import populate_cache

populate_cache()
```

in a django project, you can run

```bash
./manage.py populate_webpack_cache
```

When your `USE_CACHE_FILE` setting is `True`, the python process will read data from the cache file, 
rather than relying on an active connection to the JS compiler.


Django integration
------------------


### Installation and configuration

The following configuration should be placed in to your settings files to enable webpack to function 
seamlessly in a Django project.

Add `'webpack'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'webpack',
)
```

Add `'webpack.django_integration.WebpackFinder'` to your `STATICFILES_FINDERS`

```python
STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
    # ...
    'webpack.django_integration.WebpackFinder',
)
```

Configure webpack to respect your project's configuration

```python
WEBPACK = {
    'STATIC_ROOT': STATIC_ROOT,
    'STATIC_URL': STATIC_URL,
    'WATCH_CONFIG_FILES': DEBUG,
    'WATCH_SOURCE_FILES': DEBUG,
}
```


### Path resolution

When used in a Django project, Webpack allows you to specify relative paths to config files which will be 
resolved with Django's file finders.

For example, `webpack('app/webpack.config.js')` could match a file within an app's static directory, 
such as `/project/app/static/app/webpack.config.js`.


### Template tags

A template tag is provided as a shorthand for rendering assets.

```html
{% load webpack %}

{% webpack 'path/to/webpack.config.js' %}
```


### Management commands

A management command is provided for populating the cache.

```bash
./manage.py populate_webpack_cache
```

If `USE_CACHE_FILE` is `True`, ensure that you run this command before restarting a server.


Settings
--------

If you are using this library in a Django project, please refer to the 
[Django integration](#django-integration) section of the documentation.

Settings can be defined by calling `webpack.conf.settings.configure` with keyword arguments matching 
the setting that you want to define. For example

```python
from webpack.conf import settings

DEBUG = True

settings.configure(
    STATIC_ROOT='/path/to/your/projects/static_root',
    STATIC_URL='/static/',
    WATCH_CONFIG_FILES=DEBUG,
    WATCH_SOURCE_FILES=DEBUG,
)
```


### STATIC_ROOT

An absolute path to the root directory that you use for static assets.

For example, `'/path/to/your/projects/static_root'`.

This setting **must** be defined.

Default: `None`


### STATIC_URL

The root url that your static assets are served from.

For example, `'/static/'`.

This setting **must** be defined.

Default: `None`



### WATCH_CONFIG_FILES

A boolean flag which indicates that file watchers should be set to watch config files and 
rebuild the assets whenever a change is detected. 

Set this to `True` in development environments.

Default: `False`


### WATCH_SOURCE_FILES

A boolean flag which indicates that file watchers should be set to watch the assets's source 
files. When a change is detected, the files which have changed are recompiled in the background
so that the assets are ready for the next request.

Set this to `True` in development environments.

Default: `False`


### AGGREGATE_TIMEOUT

The delay between the detection of a change in your source files and the start of a compiler's
rebuild process.

Default: `200`


### POLL

Indicates if the watcher should poll for changes, rather than relying on the OS for notifications.

If the compiler is not detecting changes to your files, setting this to `True` may resolve the problem.

Default: `False`


### CACHE

An iterable of config file paths which are used to populate a cache file. Using this setting enables
a production instance to precompile and cache webpack's output.

To assist with precompiling any programatically generated config files, functions placed in the 
iterable will be called and their return values will be added to the list of config files precompiled.

Default: `()`


### USE_CACHE_FILE

A flag denoting that the python process should use the cache file, rather than communicating with
the js-host.

If set to `True` and you request a build for a config file which was not precompiled, exceptions will 
be raised.

Default: `False`


### CACHE_FILE

A path to a file which will be used to store webpack's cache. If the path is relative, it is joined
to js-host's `SOURCE_ROOT` setting (which defaults to your current working directory).

Default: '.webpack_cache.json'

### OUTPUT_DIR

The directory in `STATIC_ROOT` which webpack will output any generated bundles or config files.

Default: `'webpack'`


### BUNDLE_DIR

The directory into which bundles are placed in the `OUTPUT_DIR`.

Default: `'bundles'`


### CONFIG_DIR

The directory into which bundles are placed in the `OUTPUT_DIR`.

Default: `'config_files'`


### TAG_TEMPLATES

String templates which are used when rendering compiled assets. `'js'` is used if there is no matching
file extension on the emitted asset.

Default:
```python
{
    'css': '<link rel="stylesheet" href="{url}">',
    'js': '<script src="{url}"></script>',
}
```
